⭐ Difference Between git stash & git stash pop

| Command         | What it does                                  | Why we use it                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

| `git stash pop` | Restores the stashed changes and removes them | To continue your unfinished work                   |



What is git pull?
git pull downloads the latest changes from the remote repo (GitHub) and merges them into your local branch automatically.


⭐ Why do we use git pull?

Because your teammates or you (from another system) might have pushed new changes to GitHub.

To keep your local project up to date, you must run:

git pull origin main
